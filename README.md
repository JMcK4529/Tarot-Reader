# Tarot-Reader

## Project Description
This "Tarot Reader" will allow you to draw cards from a virtual Tarot deck.
It automatically arranges them in some pre-determined spread,
then tells you what it all means!

## How to Install Tarot-Reader
1. Ensure you have a Python IDE and have the following libraries installed:
      - tkinter
      - pillow (PIL)
      - pywin32
2. Download "Tarot_WIP.py", "global_deck_dict.csv" and the "Card_images" folder.
3. Before running, check that these are all saved in the same location.

## How to Use Tarot-Reader
1. Select your "spread" type from the top row of buttons.
2. Use the "Draw a card" button to draw cards until the spread is full.
(N.B. - You will receive an error message if you draw too many cards.)
3. Click the "Interpret Cards" button to see what your cards mean for you.
